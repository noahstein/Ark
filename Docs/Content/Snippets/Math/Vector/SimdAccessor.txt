Get SIMD-specific vector data. Optimizied function implementations use 
this function to access SIMD-specific data to then perform computations.

@warning The SIMD-specific data should not be accessed by general-purpose 
code. The accessor should only be called by functions implementing 
optimized versions of vector algorithms. Such optimized functions should 
only be written after a generic version is implemented first to ensure 
the algorithm is usable on all platforms.
