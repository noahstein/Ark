Vector parameter concepts have three template parameters. The first, the 
vector type, is deduced by the C++ compiler at the invocation site. The 
other two are specified in the optimized function definition. For 
example, the signature of an SSE-optimized addition function for two 4-D 
vectors of floats could look like this:

@code
template<SseFamily<float, 4> V>
inline auto operator+(V lhs, V rhs) noexcept -> V
{
	// Implmentation here...
}
@endcode
