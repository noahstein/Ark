The vector constructor is very nearly a copy constructor. The difference 
is that it accepts any object that models the Vector concept, not just 
an object of the same type. The vectors must be of the same dimension. 
The scalar types, however, may be different. The source vector's scalar 
type must be convetible to the destination's.
