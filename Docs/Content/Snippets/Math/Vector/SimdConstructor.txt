Constructs the vector from the raw SIMD ISA data. This constructor is 
to be used by SIMD-specific functions to create vectors once they've 
computed the SIMD-specific result.

@warning This constructor should not be used in general application code 
as it will not be generic across platforms and will fail to compile on 
those CPUs that lack the SIMD architecture. It cannot be made private or 
protected, though, as non-member functions that implement  SIMD-optimized 
algorithms require access to the SIMD-specfiic data.
