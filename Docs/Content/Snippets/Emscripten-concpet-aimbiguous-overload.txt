@note As of August 23, 2023; Emscripten does not properly resolve overloads
involving concepts; therefore, this function has not been implemented as a
template using concepts as for other platforms. At such time as Emscripten
does properly resolve overloads, the function signatures will switch to
templates in order to maximize reusability like for other platforms.
